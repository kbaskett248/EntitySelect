This package provides no functionality on its own. It is a support package to make it easier to
react to changing selections within a file.

The package currently supports the following concepts:
  - DocLink: If the current entity supports DocLink, it will be underlined when selected to 
    indicate there is additional information available for the entity. Pressing Alt+d will 
    open that additional information.
  - Status Identifier: If the current entity supports Status Identifier, an informational note
    will be displayed in the footer bar when that entity is selected.
  - Highlighting: If the current entity supports Highlighting, you can invoke it to highlight
    all instances of that entity within the current file, function, class, etc. You can then 
    navigate between the instances of the entity or select them all. This operates like a quick
    find for specific entities.
  - Preemptive Highlighting: If the current entity supports Preemptive Highlighting, you can
    highlight the entities without first selecting an instance of the entity. This will 
    usually happen by way of a command or keybinding.

Currently, only the Meditech Focus package requires this package.

Default Keybindings - These commands are also available in the Context Menu:
  - Alt+D - Invoke DocLink if the current entity supports it. Additional information for the 
            entity will be opened.
  - Alt+H - Invoke Highlight if the current entity supports it. All instances of the entity
            will be highlighted.
  - Alt+J - Move to the next highlighted instance.
  - Alt+K - Move to the previous highlighted instance.
  - Alt+L - Select all highlighted instances.
  - Alt+Shift+L - Display a quick panel showing all highlighted instances.
  - Esc - Clear highlights if they are visible.
